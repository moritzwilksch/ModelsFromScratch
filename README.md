# ModelsFromScratch
Code for various ML-Models from scratch.

## Linear Regression
- implements a Multiple Linear Regression Model (two features) using gradient descent algorithm

## Decision Tree
- implements a Decision Tree for two numerical features using entropy-based information gain as best split criterion

## Linear Classification
- implements a linear SVM classifier using a L2-regularized hinge loss and learning via gradient descent.

## MLP-Backprop
- implements unregularized backpropagation algorithm for a single hidden layer MLP

## L2-Regularized Logistic Regression
- implements l2-regularized binary logistic regression optimized through gradient descent
